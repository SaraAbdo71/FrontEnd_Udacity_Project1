        <h1>Birds</h1>
        <p>
          Based on the spectacular ten-part program on PBS, The Life of Birds is
          David Attenborough at his characteristic best: presenting the drama,
          beauty, and eccentricities of the natural world with unusual flair and
          intelligence. The renowned writer and filmmaker treks through rain
          forests and deserts, through city streets and isolated wilderness, to
          bring us an illuminating panorama of every aspect of birds’
          lives — from their songs to their search for food, from their eggs and
          nests to their mastery of the air. Beautifully illustrated with more
          than a hundred color photographs, the book will delight and inform
          both bird lovers and any general reader with an interest in nature.

          Attenborough begins at the beginning: reviewing ideas about how and
          when creatures first took to the air — and why ostriches, kiwis, and
          other flightless birds later returned to the ground. He introduces us
          to the marvels of flight. We encounter the albatross, which can soar
          for hours without flapping its wings; hummingbirds that beat their
          wings two hundred times a minute; and the swift, which eats, sleeps,
          and mates in mid-air. We read about birds’ extraordinary methods of
          hunting and gathering — about crows that use twigs and leaves to hook
          and harpoon insects, and eagles that can stamp venomous snakes to
          death. Attenborough explains why and how birds sing and why many have
          such dazzling plumage. He reviews courtship and mating strategies,
          including the extravagant dances of cranes and the bizarre and ornate
          pavilions that male bowerbirds build to attract females. We learn how
          birds defend their young against predators. Attenborough explains how
          birds have colonized the globe more effectively than any other
          vertebrates, adapting to Antarctic winters and African summers, to
          vast oceans and the densest, most polluted cities. He also outlines
          the threat that humans pose to many species, showing how we have
          already driven many to extinction

          Diego Calderón was researching birds in a remote area of Colombia when he was kidnapped by FARC. Now, years later,
           he’s decided to return to meet former FARC members and hopefully find some meaning in what happened.
           <p>Many can also run, jump, swim, and dive. Some, like penguins, have lost the ability to fly but retained their wings. 
           Birds are found worldwide and in all habitats. The largest is the nine-foot-tall ostrich.
            The smallest is the two-inch-long bee hummingbird.</p>
            <p>Everything about the anatomy of a bird reflects its ability to fly. The wings, for example, are shaped to create lift. The leading edge is thicker than the back edge, and they are covered in feathers that narrow to a point. Airplane wings are modeled after bird wings.

              The bones and muscles of the wing are also highly specialized. The main bone, the humerus, which is similar to the upper arm of a mammal,
               is hollow instead of solid. It also connects to the bird’s air sac system, which, in turn, 
               connects to its lungs. The powerful flight muscles of the shoulder attach to the keel,
               a special ridge of bone that runs down the center of the wide sternum, or breastbone. The tail feathers are used for steering.</p>
